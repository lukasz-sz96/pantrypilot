Then drain your tofu and use a tofu press or wrap in an absorbent towel several times and place something heavy on top to press for 15 to ~{20%minutes}.\n\nOnce pressed, slice tofu into roughly 1/2-inch cubes and arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Ensure they aren't touching so they will crisp up. Bake for 20 to ~{25%minutes} to dry/firm the tofu. NOTE: At 20 minutes, the tofu should be chewy, and at 25 minutes, the tofu should be more crispy. Bake according to preference.\n\nIn the meantime, prepare sauce by adding @peanut butter{2.5%Tbsp}, @sesame oil{1%Tbsp}, @tamari{2%Tbsp}, @maple syrup{2%Tbsp}, and @chili garlic sauce{2%tsp} to a #medium mixing bowl{} and whisking until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, or @tamari{2%tsp} for saltiness.\n\nAdd baked tofu to the peanut sauce and toss to coat. Let marinate for 10 to ~{15%minutes} to saturate the tofu and infuse the flavor.\n\nIn the meantime, prepare @cauliflower{1%small} rice by using a large grater or the grater attachment on a food processor. Set aside. Mince @garlic{2%cloves} if you haven’t already done so, and wash and slice any veggies you want to add to the dish (optional).\n\nHeat a large rimmed skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add @sesame oil{1%dash} (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering serving size), cauliflower rice, garlic, and @tamari{1%dash}. Stir and sauté, stirring occasionally, for about 5 to ~{8%minutes} until slightly browned and tender. Transfer to a serving platter.\n\nIf adding any veggies to your dish (optional), cook them now in a bit of sesame oil and a dash of tamari until just tender. Add to the cauliflower rice.\n\nTo the preheated pan, add the marinated tofu with most of the sauce (reserving a few spoonfuls for serving). Cook, stirring frequently for ~~{3%minutes} until browned. The sauce will caramelize and may stick to the pan a bit – this is normal and adds more flavor to the dish. Stir with spatula, scraping up any caramelized bits. Then transfer tofu to the cauliflower rice platter.\n\nServe with any leftover sauce. Leftovers reheat well and will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 2 to ~{3%days}.

        "Add remaining 5 cups (1200 ml // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) vegetable broth, tamari or soy sauce, and dehydrated shiitake mushrooms - stir.",
        "Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer on low for at least 1 hour, up to 2 to 3, stirring occasionally. The longer it cooks, the more the flavor will deepen and develop.",
        "Taste broth and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more soy sauce or sesame oil if desired. Add the white or yellow miso paste at this time.",
        "When you’re 30 minutes from serving, prepare any desired toppings (see notes for miso-glazed carrots (optional), miso-glazed baby bok choy (optional), and quick-seared extra-firm tofu).",
        "NOODLES: Fill a large saucepan or pot with water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add ramen noodles (depending on size of pan you may need to do this in two batches // use fewer or more batches if altering batch size) and cook according to package instructions – about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
        "Strain broth and reserve mushrooms for serving. (Save onions and ginger for serving as well, if desired, though I discarded them).",
        "To serve, divide ramen noodles between four (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) serving bowls. Top with strained broth and desired toppings, such as carrots, bok choy, chopped green onion (optional), or seared tofu. Serve with chili garlic sauce (optional (found here) for added heat.",
        "Best when fresh, though the broth can be stored (separately) in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and in the freezer for up to 1 month."

Stir @yeast{1/8%tsp}, @granulated sugar{1/2%tsp}, @salt{8%g}, and @lukewarm water{185%g} together. Cover the rough, sticky dough and let it rise at room temperature for ~{24%hours}. After this first rise, you may choose to refrigerate the dough for up to six days, which will help develop its flavor.\n\nWith a rack in the center, preheat the oven to 500°F to 550°F with a baking steel or stone inside. Make sure the oven is at least 500°F for a full ~{30%minutes} before baking your pizza, in order for the steel or stone to preheat thoroughly.\n\nDivide the dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.\n\nStretch and fold it, as follows: Holding onto the dough at both ends, pull one end away from the other, then fold it back onto itself. Repeat on the other side so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded.\n\nNext, pull the ends of the dough toward the middle, then turn it over. Using your fingers, pull the dough under itself to make a smooth, round ball with the seams tucked into the bottom. Repeat with the other piece of dough. Place each ball seam-side down into a floured #bowl{}. \n\nCover the bowls and allow the dough to proof (rise) for ~{45%minutes} to an hour, while your oven preheats.\n\nWorking with one piece at a time, transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Use your fingertips to gently depress the surface, being careful not to touch the outer edge of the crust; you want it to remain thick.\n\nLift up the crust and use your knuckles to gently stretch it into a circle about 10\" to 12\" in diameter. Move it to a well-floured #pizza peel{} or floured sheet of parchment. If you're using parchment, trim the excess around the dough to prevent it from burning.  \n\nLightly sauce the dough, then add your toppings of choice. For special toppings easy to prepare in advance see \"tips,\" below.\n\nTurn on the top broiler in your preheated oven and transfer the pie to the steel or stone. Be sure there's at least 8\" of space between the surface of the pizza and the broiler. If you have an oven with the broiler on the bottom (usually in the bottom compartment of the oven), or on top in a smaller, separate compartment, make sure there's at least 8\" between the broiler and the cooking surface. If there isn't, don't use the broiler. Your pizza will still be great without being broiled, though it may take a few more minutes to bake., Gently slide the pizza (or pizza and parchment) onto the steel or stone. Bake the pizza for approximately ~{6%minutes} on the steel (or ~{7%minutes} on the stone), until bubbly and charred on the edges. Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired., Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.\n\nTip: Substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour for a slightly less chewy crust. No other changes are necessary.\n\nTip: To make the \"Veg Vinaigrette Pizza\": Top your pie with red sauce and add a sprinkle of grated mozzarella followed by roasted butternut squash or roasted sweet potato. Bake as directed. Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with your favorite vinaigrette. When the vinaigrette hits the hot surface it blooms — i.e., becomes super aromatic. Top with quick-pickled red onions (or other pickled items in your fridge, like capers) or radishes for color, and finish with a sprinkle of feta or crumbled blue cheese.\n\nTip: To make the \"Smoky-Sweet Pizza\": Top your pie with a thin layer of BBQ sauce and sprinkle with grated mozzarella. Add sliced pears, bacon that’s been cooked about halfway (pliable, not crispy), and thinly sliced scallions that have been flash-fried in oil. Bake the pizza as directed. To finish, drizzle with BBQ sauce from a squirt bottle, or BBQ sauce mixed with tomato sauce (roughly equal measures of each).\n\nTip: The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500°F, and at temperatures between 450°F and 500°F parchment’s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450°F (especially anything on an upper rack). Burned edges can also be minimized by trimming away excess parchment before baking.\n",

To finish, drizzle with BBQ sauce from a squirt bottle, or BBQ sauce mixed with tomato sauce (roughly equal measures of each).",
        "Tip: The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500°F, and at temperatures between 450°F and 500°F parchment’s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450°F (especially anything on an upper rack). Burned edges can also be minimized by trimming away excess parchment before baking."

      "cooklangSource": ">> source: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/ultimate-sandwich-bagels-recipe\n>> serves: 8 bagels\n>> total time: 19 hours 30 minutes\n\nTo make the starter: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n\nIn a #large bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the @bread flour{120%g}, @kosher salt{1/4%tsp}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @cool water{75%g} to make a shaggy dough, then use your hand to knead gently until thoroughly combined. (This may take about a minute; it's quite stiff.) Cover the bowl and let the starter rest at room temperature for 4 to ~{14%hours}; it should expand.\n\nTo make the dough: Add\n\nall the starter, @room temperature water{170%g}, @barley malt syrup{14%g} or @dark brown sugar (alternative){13%g}, @instant yeast{3/4%tsp}, @salt{8%g}, @bread flour{300%g} in the order listed to the bowl with the starter. Mix to bring the dough together, by hand or at low speed of a #stand mixer{} with the dough hook attachment. Next, knead the stiff dough until it’s supple and elastic. This will take up to ~{15%minutes} by hand or 8 to ~{10%minutes} at medium-low speed with a mixer.\n\nPlace the dough in a #lightly greased bowl{} and let it rest, covered with a #reusable cover or plastic wrap{}, until it doubles in bulk. This will take about 2 to ~{2.5%hours} depending on the warmth of your kitchen.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a clean surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into eight equal pieces.\n\nTo preshape the dough: Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the edges into the center. Pinch to seal and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.\n\nStarting with the first piece of dough you shaped, place it seam-side down on an unfloured surface. Use your cupped fingers and palm to roll the dough into a tight ball, moving your hand in a circular motion. The dough should stick slightly to the surface in order to create tension to yield a smooth exterior. If the dough is unmanageably sticky, add a very light dusting of flour; if the dough slides around on the surface without tightening, use a damp towel to clean and moisten the surface and try again.\n\nOnce shaped into a tight ball, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.\n\nCover the preshaped dough and allow it to rest for 10 to ~{15%minutes}.\n\nLine a #baking sheet{} with #parchment{} and lightly grease the parchment; or sprinkle the parchment lightly with cornmeal, semolina, or farina, to prevent the bagels from sticking.\n\nTo shape the bagels: Working with one piece of dough at a time, use your finger to poke a hole through the center. Gently rotate the dough to expand the hole to 2\" to 3\" in diameter, forming a ring shape. Place the shaped bagel onto the prepared baking sheet. The hole will close up a bit; that’s OK.\n\nRepeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the bagels on the baking sheet in a 3-2-3 arrangement to allow them to fit nicely on one pan.\n\nCover the bagels with a reusable cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rest until they feel slightly puffy to the touch, about ~{30%minutes}.\n\nWhile the bagels are resting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Combine the @water{1808%g} and @barley malt syrup or honey{42%g} in a wide, #shallow pot{}; the water should be at least 1.25\" deep. Bring the mixture to a boil.\n\nTo boil the bagels: Add bagels to the water two or three at a time to avoid crowding. Boil for ~{60%seconds}, then use a #dough whisk or slotted spoon{} to turn the bagels over. Boil for another ~{60%seconds} before removing from the water and placing on the prepared pan.\n\nIf adding a topping, such as @Everything bagel topping (optional){47%g}, brush each bagel with the @egg{1} and @water{1%Tbsp} (egg wash) and dip into a bowl of your desired topping before transferring back to the pan.\n\nBake the bagels until golden brown, 18 to ~{22%minutes}. Rotate the pan (front to back, back to front) halfway through baking to ensure even browning.\n\nRemove the bagels from the oven and transfer them to a #cooling rack{} to cool.\n\nStorage information: Prepared bagel sandwiches can be stored, well-wrapped in foil, in the refrigerator for up to two days or in the freezer for up to a month. (See “tips,” below, for reheating instructions.) Bagels that aren’t made into sandwiches can be stored, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days, or frozen for longer storage.\n\nTip: To bake your bagels first thing in the morning: Prepare the dough up through step 5 (complete the kneading process) and allow it to rise for just 1 hour. Continue following the recipe through step 12 (shaping the bagels). Immediately place the baking sheet with the prepared bagels, covered, into the refrigerator overnight (8 to ~{12%hours}). The next morning, continue the recipe as written starting at step 14 (preheating the oven). Leave the bagels in the refrigerator until the water bath is boiling and the oven is preheated.\n",

In a #large bowl{}, combine the starter ingredients.\n\nTo make the starter: Mix @water{113%g}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @all-purpose flour{120%g} together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.\n\nTo make the dough: Mix and knead @water{255%g}, starter, @instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @all-purpose flour{420%g}, and @salt{2%tsp} together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nPlace the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.\n\nRound each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better with your schedule.\n\nWorking with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.\n\nTurn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.\n\nWith the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16\" log. Your goal is a 15\" baguette, so 16\" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical \"pointy\" end.\n\nPlace the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (\"marshmallow-y\" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).\n\nTowards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a #cast iron pan{} on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.\n\nIf your baguettes have risen in a #dish towel or couche{}, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of #parchment{}, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet.\n\nUsing a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.\n\nLoad the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.\n\nBake the baguettes - on the pan, or on a stone - for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2\", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.\n\nStorage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage.

Add the @lukewarm water{1/2%cup} and stir gently to mix. Set aside until foamy, 5 to ~{10%minutes}. In a #stand mixer{} fitted with a dough hook, mix together the @all-purpose flour{4.5%cups}, 1/3 cup @granulated sugar{1/3%cup}, and 2 teaspoons @vanilla{2%tsp}.\n\nIn a @medium saucepan{}, scald the @milk{1/2%cup} (bring almost to a boil, until milk is just simmering). Allow to sit for ~{1%minute} to cool just slightly.\n\nWith mixer on low, add the water and​yeast mixture, milk, and @melted butter{3/4%cup}. Add the @eggs{2} one at a time.\n\nWhen the dough begins to come together, after 2 to ~{3%minutes}, turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides. Raise the speed to high and mix for another 5 to ~{10%minutes} until the dough is shiny, elastic, and smooth. It may seem like a long time to mix, but the result is worth the wait.\n\nPlace dough in a #greased bowl{} with a #damp towel{} on top. Allow to rise 1 to ~{2%hours}.\n\nMake the sugar syrup while the dough is rising: Combine the @water{2/3%cup}, @granulated sugar{1%cup}, and @vanilla{1%tsp} in a #small saucepan{}. Bring to a low boil until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside and cool. This syrup can be kept in the fridge for 2 to ~{3%months} and makes enough for at least 2 batches of babka (6 medium babkas).\n\nPrepare three greased #8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans{}. Note: you can also make two larger round babkas that can be baked on baking sheets.\n\nTo make the chocolate filling, beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) room temperature @unsalted butter{3/4%cup} with 1/2 cup @granulated sugar{1/2%cup} until smooth. Add 1/3 cup @unsweetened cocoa powder{1/3%cup}, 6 ounces melted @dark chocolate{6%oz} (you can also use good-quality dark chocolate chips), 1/4 teaspoon ground @cinnamon{1/4%tsp}, and a pinch of @salt{1%pinch}.\n\nCut the dough into three equal parts (use a food scale for precision). Roll out one part into a rectangle. Spread one-third of the 1 to 1.5 cups of @chocolate or cinnamon sugar filling{1.5%cups} onto the rectangle and roll up along the shorter side (to create swirls inside).\n\nOnce the dough is formed into a swirled log, cut it straight down the middle so the filling is exposed.\n\nCut 1/2 inch off each end.\n\nLayer each cut piece on top of one another and twist. Place in a greased #loaf pan{}.\n\nRepeat with the other two pieces of babka dough. Lightly drape a kitchen towel over the top of the pans. Allow to rise another ~{30%minutes}. Preheat oven to 350°F while the dough rises.\n\nBake for ~{20%minutes}. Brush each babka with two layers of sugar syrup. Place back in the oven for approximately ~{15%minutes}. The edges should be slightly brown and the middle should be slightly doughy.\n\nWhen the babkas come out of the oven, immediately brush each with another 3 light layers of sugar syrup. Allow to cool for 5 to ~{10%minutes}. Using a butter knife, loosen the sides of the babka from the pan and place on top of wire rack to cool.\n",

        "For the dough: Place the dry active yeast and 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar in a small bowl. Add the lukewarm water and stir gently to mix. Set aside until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, mix together the all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla.",
        "In a medium saucepan, scald the milk (bring almost to a boil, until milk is just simmering). Allow to sit for 1 minute to cool just slightly.",
        "With mixer on low, add the water and​yeast mixture, milk, and melted butter. Add the eggs one at a time.",
        "When the dough begins to come together, after 2 to 3 minutes, turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides. Raise the speed to high and mix for another 5 to 10 minutes until the dough is shiny, elastic, and smooth. It may seem like a long time to mix, but the result is worth the wait.",
        "Place dough in a greased bowl with a damp towel on top. Allow to rise 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Make the sugar syrup while the dough is rising: Combine the water, granulated sugar, and vanilla in a small saucepan. Bring to a low boil until the sugar has dissolved. Set aside and cool. This syrup can be kept in the fridge for 2 to 3 months and makes enough for at least 2 batches of babka (6 medium babkas).",
        "Prepare three greased 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans. Note: you can also make two larger round babkas that can be baked on baking sheets.",
        "To make the chocolate filling, beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) room temperature unsalted butter with 1/2 cup granulated sugar until smooth. Add 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 6 ounces melted dark chocolate (you can also use good-quality dark chocolate chips), 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.",
        "Cut the dough into three equal parts (use a food scale for precision). Roll out one part into a rectangle. Spread one-third of the 1 to 1.5 cups of chocolate or cinnamon sugar filling onto the rectangle and roll up along the shorter side (to create swirls inside).",
        "Once the dough is formed into a swirled log, cut it straight down the middle so the filling is exposed.",
        "Cut 1/2 inch off each end.",
        "Layer each cut piece on top of one another and twist. Place in a greased loaf pan.",
        "Repeat with the other two pieces of babka dough. Lightly drape a kitchen towel over the top of the pans. Allow to rise another 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F while the dough rises.",
        "Bake for 20 minutes. Brush each babka with two layers of sugar syrup. Place back in the oven for approximately 15 minutes. The edges should be slightly brown and the middle should be slightly doughy.",
        "When the babkas come out of the oven, immediately brush each with another 3 light layers of sugar syrup. Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Using a butter knife, loosen the sides of the babka from the pan and place on top of wire rack to cool."

      "cooklangSource": ">> source: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/big-and-bubbly-focaccia-recipe\n>> serves: 1 8\" square\n\nTo make the dough: Weigh your @all-purpose flour{360%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a #large bowl{} (a 3-quart bowl with a lid works great), whisk together the flour, @salt{9%g}, @granulated sugar{5%g}, and @yeast{1%tsp}.\n\nAdd the @lukewarm water{284%g} and @olive oil{18%g} and stir — with a #spatula, bowl scraper, dough whisk{}, or your hands — until the mixture is thoroughly combined and homogeneous; there should be no dry patches or lumps. Cover the bowl and set it aside for ~{15%minutes}. \n\nPerform the first bowl fold: Use a wet hand to grab a section of dough from one side of the bowl, then lift it up and press it into the center. Repeat this motion, grabbing a new section of dough each time, until you've made a full circle around the bowl, about 8 to 12 times. Once you’ve circled the bowl, flip the dough over in the bowl so that the smooth side is up; the first bowl fold is now complete. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for ~{15%minutes}. \n\nNote: You’ll be doing this 3 more times over the next ~{45%minutes}, each time further developing the dough’s strength.  \n\nRepeat the bowl fold for a second time. (Remember to use a wet hand to prevent the dough from sticking!) At this point, the dough should feel smoother and tighter. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.  \n\nRepeat the bowl fold for a third time. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.\n\nRepeat the bowl fold for a fourth and final time; the dough should feel relatively strong. \n\nCover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature (70°F to 75°F) for ~{1%hour}. After 1 hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size and will be very puffy; it may even have a few bubbles on the surface.\n\nTo prepare the pan: Once the dough has risen, spray the bottom and sides of a #9\" square Fabulous Focaccia Pan{} with #nonstick spray{}. Cut a #3\"-wide strip of parchment{} that's about 16\" long. Lay the strip across the center of the pan, leaving a few inches of overhang on 2 sides; press it firmly into the pan and crease the parchment where it meets the sides of the pan to help it stay in place. (The parchment tabs will help you remove the focaccia from the pan later on.) \n\nSpray the parchment with nonstick spray, then add 1 tablespoon (13 g) of the @olive oil{13%g} and tilt the pan to spread the oil evenly across the bottom.\n\nUse a bowl scraper or flexible spatula to gently transfer the risen dough to the center of the pan. Using your hand as paddles (and a bowl scraper for assistance, if you need it) swiftly but gently flip the dough over so that it’s coated in oil; try to handle the dough minimally to keep it from deflating.\n\nCover the pan and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 to ~{1.5%hours}, until it’s marshmallowy and jiggly; the dough should nearly fill the corners of the pan and be very close to the top edge.\n\nToward the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 475°F with racks in the upper and lower thirds.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, lightly coat your fingers in oil. Starting at one edge, press your fingertips into the dough until they reach the bottom of the pan, creating dimples. Repeat this process, working your way from one edge to the other, spacing the dimples about 1 1/2\" apart. The goal is to thoroughly dimple the dough without deflating it — aim for decisive yet gentle motions. If there are any large untouched areas of the dough, add additional dimples using one finger.\n\nTo top the dough: Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon (13 g) @olive oil{13%g} all over the surface of the dough; it’s OK if it pools in some dimples. Sprinkle evenly with @flaky salt{} (use 1 generously rounded teaspoon Cyprus Flake Salt or 1/2 teaspoon Maldon).\n\nBake the focaccia on the lower rack for 15 to ~{18%minutes}, until brown in the highest spots and golden in the crevices. If necessary, move the pan to the top rack and broil briefly for the final 1 to ~{2%minutes}, watching carefully, to achieve the desired color.\n\nRemove the focaccia fro the oven. Using the parchment tabs as handles, lift the focaccia out of the pan and transfer it to a wire rack or cutting board; remove the parchment strip. Turn off the oven and slide the focaccia back into the oven, directly on the lower rack, for 5 to ~{7%minutes}, until the sides are golden brown and crisp. Remove the focaccia from the oven once again and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\nFocaccia is best enjoyed the day it's made. If storing leftovers, wrap the focaccia loosely in foil, keep it at room temperature, and reheat before serving.\n",

      "cooklangSource": ">> source: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/brioche-recipe\n>> time required: 410 minutes\n>> serves: 1 large loaf\n\nAdd all ingredients to the refrigerator so that they are cold when making the dough.\n\nWeigh your @all-purpose flour{330%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n\nTo make the dough: In a #medium bowl{}, mix together flour, @dry milk{28%g}, @salt{8%g}, and @instant yeast{1%Tbsp}.\n\nIn the bowl of a #stand mixer{} fitted with the #dough hook{} attachment, add the cold @eggs{3%large}, cool @water{57%g}, then the dry ingredients, (except the butter) to make a smooth, stretchy dough that cleans the sides of the bowl; this should take 7 to ~{10%minutes} at medium speed.\n\nIf the dough looks too dry, add the @granulated sugar{35%g} earlier during mixing process. The sugar should be added later to give the dough time to come together because the sugar acts as a liquefying agent.\n\nUsing a #rolling pin{}, beat the cold butter to make it pliable.\n\nOnce the dough has developed some strength and elasticity, add one piece of the cold @unsalted butter{142%g}, about 28 g, and mix at medium speed until it’s fully incorporated into the dough, 1 to ~{2%minutes}. Scrape the bowl if necessary, then continue adding the butter one piece at a time, mixing to incorporate fully before adding the next piece. This dough takes longer than most to develop so be prepared to let the dough knead for another 5 to ~{10%minutes}, or until it's formed a soft, smooth ball. We don't recommend trying to knead this dough by hand.\n\nForm the dough into a ball (it'll be very soft), place it in a greased #bowl{}, cover the bowl, and it let rise for ~{1%hour}. Then refrigerate the dough for several hours, or overnight. This will slow the fermentation and chill the butter, making the dough easier to shape.\n\nDivide the chilled dough into 12 pieces to make mini-brioche (brioche buns); leave it whole for one large round brioche; or divide it in half for two 8 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" loaves.\n\nPlace the dough into the greased pan(s) of your choice, cover lightly, and let rise for 2.5 to ~{3%hours}, until it's doubled and looks very puffy.\n\nIf you're making two loaves, it's fun to make simple three-strand braids, and set them in the loaf pans.\n\nTo bake a large, round brioche: Place the pan into a preheated 400°F oven. After ~{10%minutes}, reduce the oven heat to 350°F and bake for about 30 to ~{35%minutes} more. Check the brioche after ~{15%minutes}; tent with aluminum foil if it appears to be browning too quickly. Brioche should be a deep brown when done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will read 190°F at the center using an #instant-read thermometer{}. (It's easy to underbake since it browns so quickly!).\n\nRemove the brioche from the oven, and after ~{10%minutes} remove it from the pan to @cool{0%cup} completely on a rack.\n\nTo bake the mini brioches: Place the pan(s) onto a baking sheet for easy handling, as shown; then nestle that baking sheet into another baking sheet, to protect the buns' bottoms from over-browning. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 15 to ~{20%minutes} (tent after ~{10%minutes} if they're browning too quickly).\n\nRemove them from the oven, let stand for ~{5%minutes}, then turn them out onto a rack.\n\nTo bake the loaves: Allow the loaves to rise until they've nearly reached the rim of the pan, about ~{3%hours}. Set the loaf pans on a baking sheet, for easy handling. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 to ~{35%minutes}, tenting with foil after 15 to ~{20%minutes}. Bake until the internal temperature reaches at least 190°F in the center, and up to 205°F for a crustier loaf.\n\nTo make the glaze: Combine the @confectioners' sugar{3%Tbsp}, @vanilla{1%tsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}. Add enough @heavy cream{2%tsp} to make a pourable consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the baked loaves, if desired.\n\nTip: If you're baking the brioche as a braided loaf, add an extra @egg yolk (optional){1} to the dough, reserving the white. Just before baking the risen loaves, whisk the reserved white with 1 tablespoon milk, brush on loaves, and sprinkle with @pearl sugar or sparkling white sugar (optional){}.\n",

Mix just until the dough comes together to form a shaggy mass; using your mixer equipped with the dough hook, this will take about ~{3%minutes} on low speed.\n\nKnead the dough, by hand or mixer, until it’s smooth and well-developed; this will take 5 to ~{6%minutes} at medium speed using your mixer.\n\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for ~{1%hour}. Refrigerate the dough for ~{1%hour}, or until it’s thoroughly chilled.\n\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. To make two large loaves, divide the dough in half; each half will weigh about 824 g.\n\nNote: For three smaller loaves see tips below.\n\nWorking with one piece of dough at a time, divide it into three, four, or six pieces (to make a standard braid, a four-strand braid, or a six-strand braid). To make the six-strand braid pictured above, divide into six pieces, each about 137 g. Preshape each piece into a rough log; you’re going to be rolling them into long strands. Cover the logs. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough, dividing it into six pieces (or however many you need for the braid you want to make).\n\nLet the covered logs relax for about ~{20%minutes}.\n\nUncover the logs. Working with the dough for one loaf, roll each log into a strand about 20\" long. Make a six-strand braid; for help with this technique, check out our video, How to braid a six-strand loaf.\n\nRepeat to make the second loaf.\n\nPlace each loaf on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.

Place the egg yolks, eggs, vegetable oil, cold water, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, salt, and instant yeast into a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer) in the order in which they’re listed. Mix just until the dough comes together to form a shaggy mass; using your mixer equipped with the dough hook, this will take about 3 minutes on low speed.",
        "Knead the dough, by hand or mixer, until it’s smooth and well-developed; this will take 5 to 6 minutes at medium speed using your mixer.",
        "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a reusable cover and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1 hour. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour, or until it’s thoroughly chilled.",
        "Remove the dough from the refrigerator, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. To make two large loaves, divide the dough in half; each half will weigh about 824 g.",
        "Note: For three smaller loaves see tips below.",
        "Working with one piece of dough at a time, divide it into three, four, or six pieces (to make a standard braid, a four-strand braid, or a six-strand braid). To make the six-strand braid pictured above, divide into six pieces, each about 137 g. Preshape each piece into a rough log; you’re going to be rolling them into long strands. Cover the logs. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough, dividing it into six pieces (or however many you need for the braid you want to make).",
        "Let the covered logs relax for about 20 minutes.",
        "Uncover the logs. Working with the dough for one loaf, roll each log into a strand about 20\" long. Make a six-strand braid; for help with this technique, check out our video, How to braid a six-strand loaf.",
        "Repeat to make the second loaf.",
        "Place each loaf on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet. Cover the loaves and let them rise at room temperature until they’re almost doubled in size, about 1.5 to 2 hours.",
        "Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 375°F.",
        "Whisk together the egg and water for the topping and pour it through a sieve to remove any clumps of egg. Brush the risen loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds.",
        "Bake the loaves for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they’re a rich golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Their interior temperature should register about 210°F using a digital thermometer.",

Now gently cut off the exposed bit of butter, without going through the dough, and put it on the top of the dough you have just folded down. Fold the bottom half of the dough up. You will now have a sandwich of two layers of butter and three of dough. Pinch the edges lightly to seal in the butter.

Cover and let rest at room temperature for about ~{14%hours}; overnight works well. The preferment should have expanded and become bubbly.\n\nTo make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — the preferment, @active dry yeast or instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @water{1.125%cups} (255 g, lukewarm), @unbleached all-purpose flour{3.5%cups} (420 g) and @table salt{2%tsp} — by hand, mixer or #bread machine{} set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough.\n\nIf you're using a #stand mixer{}, knead for about ~{4%minutes} on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nPlace the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}.\n\nGently deflate the dough and fold its edges in to the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional ~{45%minutes}, until it's noticeably puffy.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into 3 equal pieces. Cover with greased #plastic wrap{} or your favorite reusable cover and let rest for ~{15%minutes}; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better for your schedule.\n\nTo preshape the loaves: Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly. Fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand. Turn the dough around, and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.\n\nWith the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16\" log. Your goal is a 15\" épi de blé, so 16\" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the épi de blé's typical shape.\n\nTo shape the épi de blé: Hold a pair of #scissors{} at a low angle at one end of the loaf and open the scissors so they're wider than the width of the bread. Make a swift, clean cut three-fourths of the way into the dough, moving the cut piece to one side of the loaf. Repeat the process 2\" to 3\" farther down the loaf, moving the newly cut piece to the opposite side of the loaf from the first.

        "To make the preferment: Mix water (113 g, cool), active dry yeast or instant yeast and unbleached all-purpose flour (120 g) together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The preferment should have expanded and become bubbly.",
        "To make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — the preferment, active dry yeast or instant yeast, water (255 g, lukewarm), unbleached all-purpose flour (420 g) and table salt — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough.",
        "If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.",
        "Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for 45 minutes.",
        "Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges in to the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into 3 equal pieces. Cover with greased plastic wrap or your favorite reusable cover and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to 1 hour, if that works better for your schedule.",
        "To preshape the loaves: Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly. Fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand. Turn the dough around, and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.",
        "With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16\" log. Your goal is a 15\" épi de blé, so 16\" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the épi de blé's typical shape.",
        "To shape the épi de blé: Hold a pair of scissors at a low angle at one end of the loaf and open the scissors so they're wider than the width of the bread. Make a swift, clean cut three-fourths of the way into the dough, moving the cut piece to one side of the loaf. Repeat the process 2\" to 3\" farther down the loaf, moving the newly cut piece to the opposite side of the loaf from the first. Continue doing this until you reach the other end of the loaf.",
        "!!! note",
        "The deeper you cut into the loaf, the more elegant (though fragile) your épi will be.",
        "Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough to make a total of three shaped loaves.",

In a #medium bowl{}, combine the @all-purpose flour{222%g}, @instant yeast{1/4%generous tsp}, and @cool water{222%g}. Mix until no dry patches of flour remain. Cover and let it rest overnight at room temperature, 12 to ~{16%hours}.\n\nAdd the @warm water{319%g} to the preferment, then squeeze the preferment through your fingers to break it up. Next, holding your hand in a claw-like position, vigorously mix the preferment into the water until well combined. The mixture will look like foamy milk with some small pieces of preferment still visible.  \n\nAdd the @all-purpose flour{519%g}, @salt{15%g}, and @instant yeast{1/2%scant tsp}, mixing well until no dry spots remain. Using a wet hand and a light touch, quickly work the dough against the side of the bowl until it begins to smooth out and is tacky.  \n\nOnce you’ve mixed your dough, let it rest, covered, for ~{20%minutes}.  \n\nTo fold the dough. Using a wet hand or #bowl scraper{}, reach down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat 8 to 12 more times, working your way around the bowl. This process of stretching the dough, which takes the place of kneading, is called a bowl fold.\n\nCover and let the dough rest for another ~{20%minutes}, then perform another bowl fold.  \n\nLet the dough rest for ~{20%minutes}, then perform a coil fold. With wet hands, reach under the dough and stretch the middle upward until the dough releases from the dish. Roll it forward off your hands, allowing it to fold over (or “coil”) on itself. Rotate the bowl 90° (a quarter turn) and repeat 2 to 3 more times, until the dough resists stretching.\n\nCover and let the dough rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}, or until it feels very puffy and marshmallowy.  \n\nUse a bowl scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl and onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour, then divide the dough into 2 even pieces (650 g each).\n\nGently preshape each piece of dough into a round.\n\nCover the preshaped dough and let it rest on a lightly floured surface for ~{15%minutes}.\n\nGenerously dust two 9\" x 3\" #round or oval proofing baskets (brotforms){} with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a boule or bâtard, then place them seam-side up in the prepared baskets.\n\nCover the baskets and let the dough rise until it looks and feels marshmallowy and a small indentation remains when pressed with a floured finger, 45 minutes to ~{1%hour}. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475°F with a baking steel or stone on the middle rack and an empty #cast iron skillet{} or a cake pan filled with lava rocks on the rack below. If possible, adjust the stone and pan so that the skillet isn't directly under the stone, making it easier for steam to reach the baking bread.\n\nWhen ready to bake, gently invert the loaves side by side onto a sheet of #parchment{}. Use a #baker’s lame or razor blade{} to score the tops of the loaves.\n\nLoad the loaves (still on the parchment) into the oven, placing them on the stone, and carefully pour about 1 cup (roughly 227 g) warm water into the skillet. \n\nBake the loaves for 32 to ~{38%minutes}, until the crust is firm and medium golden brown. Let the loaves cool completely before slicing. French bread is best eaten the day it's baked. Freeze for longer storage.\n\nTip: If you’d like, you can replace the generous 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast in the preferment with 1 tablespoon (14 g) sourdough culture for more flavor.\n\nTip: You can substitute up to 25% whole wheat in place of some of the all-purpose flour in the final dough without making any significant changes to hydration. To do this, make the preferment as written, then use 3 1/4 cups (390g) all-purpose flour and 1 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons (130 g) whole wheat flour in the dough.

Lightly grease an #8\" or 9\" round cake pan{}.\n\nIn a #medium-sized mixing bowl{}, whisk together the @Irish-style flour{276%g}, @bread flour{150%g}, @granulated sugar{37%g}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @kosher salt{1.5%tsp}, and @currants{95%g} or @raisins (alternative){99%g}.\n\nUsing a #mixer{}, a pastry fork or blender, or your fingers, work in the @unsalted butter{57%g} until it's evenly distributed and no large chunks remain.\n\nIn a separate #bowl{} (or in a measuring cup) whisk together the @buttermilk{302%g} and @egg{1%large}. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and mix to combine. The dough will be stiff; if it's too crumbly to squeeze together, add another tablespoon or two of buttermilk.\n\nKnead the dough a couple of times to make sure it's holding together, then shape it into a ball. Flatten the ball slightly, and place the loaf in your pan. Use a #sharp knife{} to cut a 1/2\" deep cross in the loaf.\n\nBake the bread for about 45 to ~{55%minutes}, until it's golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the bread from the oven and brush the top with melted butter.\n\nStore for about 2 days, well wrapped, at room temperature; freeze for longer storage (up to about a month).\n\nTip: Our Irish-style flour will result in a soda bread with superior flavor and texture. Substituting premium whole wheat or white whole wheat flour is fine, but you'll want to reduce the amount of @whole wheat (alternative){254%g} to 2 1/4 cups and substitute the bread flour with @all-purpose flour (alternative){150%g}.\n",

      "cooklangSource": ">> source: https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/overnight-baguettes-recipe\n>> serves: 3 baguettes\n>> total time: 13 hours\n\nTo make the dough: For best results, weigh your flour; this recipe was developed by metric weight. However, if you prefer to work with volume measurements, please be sure to measure your flour the King Arthur way: gently spoon the flour into a cup, then sweep off any excess.\n\nIn a medium bowl, combine @all-purpose flour{315%g}, @whole wheat flour{78%g}, @water{325%g}*, @salt{9%g}, @instant yeast{1/4%tsp}, @sourdough starter{24%g} that has been fed within the last 24 hours, and stir to combine. Once the mass is mostly homogeneous, use a bowl scraper to further press and smear the dough, smoothing it slightly.\n\nTransfer the dough to a #lightly greased container{} (such as a 2-quart dough-rising bucket). The dough should measure between 74°F and 78°F. Cover the container and set a 30-minute timer.\n\nTo fold the dough: After ~{30%minutes}, perform a bowl fold: Lift the side of the dough, stretching upward, then press it down into the middle. Repeat this motion, working around the dough, for a total of 8 to 12 stretches and folds. After the last fold, turn the dough over so that it’s seam-side down in the container. Cover and let it rest for 30 more minutes.\n\nAfter the rest, mark the height of the dough in the container with a large rubber band or a piece of tape. Place the dough in the refrigerator to rise for 8 to ~{24%hours}.\n\nAfter the cold rise, allow the dough to warm slightly at room temperature, anywhere between 1 and ~{2%hours}. By this point, the dough should have risen in volume 1 1/2 to 2 times.\n\nTo preshape the baguettes: Lightly sprinkle the surface of the dough in the container with whole wheat flour, then use a #bowl scraper{} to release the sides of the dough so that it can turn out without pulling or tearing. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly flour the top, then divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 250 g each).\n\nUse lightly floured hands to pat each piece of dough into a rough 6\" square, pressing gently to pop any air bubbles. Starting with the first piece of dough you handled, shape it into a tube: Fold in the left side and the right side to meet in the middle then press to gently seal. Starting at the top, fold the rectangle towards yourself in 3 motions, pressing gently after each fold, to create a cylinder with the seam-side down. The entire time you work, apply flour as needed to make sure the dough is moving easily on the work surface, with no wet bits threatening to stick. Repeat this process with the other 2 pieces of dough. Cover the preshaped dough and let them rest for 15 minutes.\n\nTo shape the baguettes: Move a piece of preshaped dough to the center of the lightly floured surface and stretch it gently to elongate on the east/west axis, then pat it lightly to remove any bubbles. Next, fold the dough from the top down 2/3 of the way and pat to gently seal. Rotate the dough 180° and again fold toward you to bring the dough 2/3 of the way down; pat gently to seal. Last, make a gentle east/west divot in the middle of the dough and then fold the top of the dough down to the bottom edge and press to seal with the heel of your hand.\n\nWith the seam-side down, place a single palm in the middle of the dough and roll it gently back and forth. With light pressure, a depression will form, turning the log into a dog bone shape. Next, add your second hand and roll the dough side to side, pushing it back and forth so that it travels across the work surface; slowly move your hands apart and toward the tips of the baguette, adding pressure so that the ends taper. If the dough is resistant, go back to the middle and take another pass. Aim for your baguettes to be 16\" to 18\" in length so that they fit comfortably on your baking stone or steel (use a half-sheet of parchment as your guide).\n\nOnce shaped, place the baguette seam-side up onto a baker’s couche or stiff cotton dish towel that’s been lightly dusted with whole wheat flour. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.\n\nCover the baguettes and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy. The loaves should look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but they will not have doubled in size. This should take about 45 to ~{60%minutes} at room temperature (about 68°F); it could take as few as ~{30%minutes} in a warm environment. Meanwhile, prepare your oven for baking.\n\nWhile the dough rises, preheat the oven to 500°F with a cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven, or on the lowest rack. (If you can fit two cast iron pans, even better; alternatively, use a 9\" x 13\" pan that you are comfortable reserving for this purpose; it may warp.) Place a baking steel or stone on the middle rack above the pans to preheat.\n\nGently roll the proofed baguettes onto a transfer peel so that they're seam-side down, then nudge them onto a piece of parchment, still seam-side down. (If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment placed on an inverted baking sheet.) For the easiest scoring, chill the baguettes for ~{10%minutes} in the refrigerator.\n\nUsing a baker's lame held at about a 30° to 45° angle, make 1, 3, or 5 long lengthwise cuts in each baguette.\n\nTo bake the baguettes: Load the baguettes into the oven. Use a baker's peel, a rimless baking sheet, or an inverted baking sheet to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot steel or stone. Carefully pour about 1 cup of water into the cast iron pan(s) and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise and give them a lovely, shiny crust.\n\nImmediately reduce the oven temperature to 475°F.\n\nBake the baguettes for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're very deep golden brown. For the crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, prop the door open about 2\", and let the baguettes dry out for an additional 10 minutes. Remove baguettes from the oven and cool them on a rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.\n\nStorage information: These overnight baguettes are best eaten fresh. Wrap the bread loosely and store any leftovers at room temperature for up to several days; freeze for longer storage.\n\nFor cooler months (air and flour temperature around 65°F), use 85°F to 95°F water. In warmer months (air and flour temperature around 75°F), use 65°F to 75°F water.\n",

Put the @strong white bread flour{350%g} in a #mixing bowl{}. Cut 25g of the @butter{250%g} into cubes, add these to the bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the @caster sugar{30%g}, @fast-action dried yeast{7%g} and @salt{1%tsp} and stir to combine.\n\nBeat the @whole milk{125%ml}, @warm water{50%ml} and @egg{1%large} together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a #wooden spoon{} to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a #dough scraper{} for ~{5%minutes}, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough and chill it for ~{1%hour}.\n\nPlace the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of #baking paper{} and flatten it out with a #rolling pin{} to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19 cm.\n\nLightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1 cm thick and measuring 50 x 20 cm. With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.\n\nFold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough. Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side. Wrap the dough and chill it for ~{20%minutes} to harden the butter.\n\nWith the seam still on the left, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle, about 1 cm thick and 50 x 20 cm, as before. With a short end of the dough closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top.

Pour the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisk until well combined. Return the mixture to the pan and heat it gently, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency. Pour the crème pâtissière into a bowl, cover the surface and leave it to cool. Then, chill it until set.\n\nFinish the pain aux raisins. Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle about 1 cm thick and 50 x 20 cm, as before. With one of the short edges closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Roll out the dough to a 30cm square.\n\nSpread the crème pâtissière over the dough, leaving a 2 cm border on the side furthest from you.\n\nSprinkle the @raisins{100%g}, @cinnamon{1/4%tsp} and @orange{1} zest over the crème pâtissière, then starting from the edge furthest from you, roll the dough towards you into a spiralled sausage shape, keeping it as tight as possible – give the dough a gentle tug each time you roll to tighten it up and give it a little tension. When you reach the end, roll the sausage back and forth a few times to seal the join.\n\nCut the roll into 12 equal slices, each about 2.5–3cm wide. Lay the slices, cut-side up and spaced apart to allow for rising, on the lined baking trays. Put each tray inside a proving bag and leave the dough to prove for ~{1%hour}, until it has at least doubled in size.\n\nHeat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7.

Cover the bowl or bucket and let the dough rest at room temperature for ~{15%minutes}.\n\nFold the dough by grabbing a section from one side with a wet hand, lifting it up, then pressing it down to the middle to seal. Repeat this with the remaining three sides of the dough. Cover and let it rest for ~{15%minutes}.\n\nFold the dough two more times, giving it a 15-minute rest between the two, for a total of three sets of folds in ~{45%minutes}. As you perform the folds you’ll notice that the dough smooths out, gaining strength and becoming elastic.\n\nCover the dough tightly after the final fold and leave it at room temperature (approximately 72°F) for about ~{12%hours}. It's helpful to mark the height of the dough (use the markings on the bucket or a large rubber band around your bowl) to gauge how much it rises.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured or greased surface and divide it into two roughly equal pieces. Gently form the pieces into rounds, cover them, and let them rest seam-side down for ~{10%minutes}.\n\nGenerously dust two lined brotforms or towel-lined large bowls with whole wheat flour.\n\nShape the loaves into tight rounds (boules), place them seam-side up into the prepared brotforms or bowls, and cover them with a plastic bag or shower cap.\n\nIf your dough doubled (or came close to doubling) during the 12-hour rise period, immediately place the boules into the refrigerator. But if your dough was a bit more sluggish, let the boules rest at room temperature for 30 to ~{60%minutes} to give them a head start on the second rise.\n\nLet the boules rest in the refrigerator for 8 to ~{12%hours}, depending on your schedule (not theirs!).\n\nWhen you're ready to bake, place two Dutch ovens or other lidded bread bakers onto a rack set in the lowest third of the oven. If you just have one Dutch oven or don't have room for two in your oven, you can certainly bake one loaf at a time, leaving the other in the refrigerator while the first one bakes. Preheat the oven (and Dutch ovens) to 500°F for ~{45%minutes} (you'll want to ensure that they're tough enough to withstand preheating; not all are).\n\nTurn each loaf out onto a piece of #parchment paper{} and slash them with a lame or sharp knife.\n\nRemove the preheated Dutch ovens from the oven. With the help of the parchment, carefully transfer the loaves to the Dutch ovens. \n\nCover the #Dutch ovens{} with their lids and place them in the oven.\n\nImmediately reduce the oven temperature to 450°F and bake the covered loaves for ~{20%minutes}. Remove the lids from the Dutch ovens and bake the loaves for 20 to ~{25%minutes} uncovered, until they're a deep golden brown.\n\nRemove the loaves from the oven and carefully turn them out of the Dutch ovens onto racks to cool completely.

Do not add flour, as you want friction between the dough and the surface. Place the ball in the prepared pan and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, spacing to make a 6 X 4 grid. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until rolls are nearly doubled in size, 45 to ~{60%minutes}.\n\nMeanwhile, place a rack in the middle of the oven.

The fermentation process develops flavor, so slower and longer is always best.\n\nWhile the dough is resting, mix the following ingredients for the decoration: @margarine{6%Tbsp} with the @confectioners' sugar{1/2%cup} until it is creamy. Then add in the @all-purpose flour{3/4%cup} and @egg yolk{1}. Until you have a smooth paste.\n\nAfter the first resting period. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead a few times, then shape into a round cushion and making a hole in the middle shape into a large ring. Transfer to a #greased rimmed baking sheet{}, and loosely cover with buttered plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for ~{45%minutes} or more until almost double in volume. Gather all your decorations and the egg wash. For the egg wash whisk remaining @egg{1} with @milk or water{1%Tbsp}.\n\nPreheat oven at least 20 minutes before baking at 375°F, with rack in lower third.\n\nBrush the dough with the egg wash two times for a golden crust. Form strips with the confectioner sugar paste and decorate the dough. Place some of the @dried figs, candied citron, quince paste stripes, orange peels or cherries{}, pressing them gently into the dough. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for ~{10%minutes}. Reduce heat to 350°F and bake for ~{10%minutes} more until bread is a nice golden brown color. Depending on your oven it will require more time. (Some readers had reported baking for 30 minutes)\n\nTransfer the bread to a #wire rack{} to cool. After the bread has cooled insert the plastic baby dolls from the bottom of the bread.

The dough should be soft and elastic, but not particularly sticky; add additional flour if necessary.\n\nPlace the dough in a #lightly greased bowl{}, cover, and set it aside to rise for about ~{1.5%hours}, or until it's noticeably puffy. For most pronounced sour flavor, cover the bowl, and immediately place it in the refrigerator (without rising first). Let the dough chill for ~{24%hours}; this will develop its flavor.\n\nGently deflate the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, cover it, and let it sit for a few minutes, to relax the gluten. Divide the dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll 1/2\" thick, and cut in 3\" rounds. Re-roll and cut any remaining scraps. Repeat with the remaining half of dough.\n\nAlternatively, divide the dough into 24 pieces (total). Shape each piece into a round ball, then flatten each ball into a 3\" round. For a somewhat more even rise as the muffins cook, flatten each ball slightly larger than 3\", and trim edges with a 3\" cutter (or trim all around the edge with a pair of scissors). Muffins with cut (rather than flattened) sides will rise more evenly.\n\nPlace the rounds, evenly spaced, onto @cornmeal or semolina (optional){} sprinkled #baking sheets{} (12 per sheet). Sprinkle them with additional cornmeal or semolina, cover with #plastic wrap{}, and let them rise until light and puffy, about 45 to ~{60%minutes}. If the dough has been refrigerated overnight, the rise time will be about 2 hours.\n\nCarefully transfer the rounds (as many as a time that will fit without crowding) right-side up to a large electric griddle preheated to 350°F, or to an ungreased frying pan that has been preheated over medium-low heat.\n\nCook the muffins for about ~{5%minutes} on their first side; then lay a cake pan, cookie sheet, or similar flat (though not overly heavy) object atop them to help keep them flat. Continue cooking for about 7 minutes or so; then remove the pan, turn the muffins over, and finish cooking without the pan on top for a total of about 10 to ~{12%minutes} or when the center of a muffin registers 190°F on a digital thermometer. If you're having trouble getting muffins to cook all the way through on the stovetop, cook until golden brown on both sides, then transfer to a preheated 350°F oven and bake until the muffins' interior shows no sign of wet dough, about 10 minutes or so.\n\nRemove the muffins from the griddle, and cool on a rack. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature for 4 or ~{5%days}; freeze for longer storage.\n\nTip: To shorten cooking time, use a lidded electric fry pan heated to 325°F. Cook the muffins for about 10 minutes without the lid (or until they're nicely browned), turn them over, and add the lid. Don't set the lid on tight; leave a small opening for any steam to escape. Cook the muffins for an additional 8 to ~{10%minutes}, until their bottom sides are browned.\n\nTip: This recipe is easily halved, if you don't want to make 2 dozen muffins. Halve all of the ingredients; for a slightly faster rise, use 2 teaspoons yeast, rather than 1 1/2 teaspoons.\n",

        "Tip: To shorten cooking time, use a lidded electric fry pan heated to 325°F. Cook the muffins for about 10 minutes without the lid (or until they're nicely browned), turn them over, and add the lid. Don't set the lid on tight; leave a small opening for any steam to escape. Cook the muffins for an additional 8 to 10 minutes, until their bottom sides are browned.",
        "Tip: This recipe is easily halved, if you don't want to make 2 dozen muffins. Halve all of the ingredients; for a slightly faster rise, use 2 teaspoons yeast, rather than 1 1/2 teaspoons."

      "title": "The Easiest Loaf of Bread You'll Ever Bake",

Use a #sturdy spoon{}, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.\n\nIf you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about ~{6%minutes}. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.\n\nIf you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.\n\nPlace the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with @vegetable oil or cooking spray{}; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to ~{2%hours}. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.\n\nGently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.\n\nWorking with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.\n\nPlace the loaves, seam-side down, on a #baking sheet{} (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with @cornmeal{}; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.\n\nLet the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for ~{45%minutes}. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.\n\nTowards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.\n\nFor extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty #cast-iron frying pan{} on the lowest rack.

        "Stir together 540 g to 600 g bread flour, granulated sugar, instant yeast, salt, and lukewarm (90-110°F) water in a large bowl, starting with 540 g of the flour. Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.",
        "If you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about 6 minutes. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.",
        "If you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.",
        "Place the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with vegetable oil or cooking spray; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.",
        "Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.",
        "Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.",
        "Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a baking sheet (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with cornmeal; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.",
        "Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for 45 minutes. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.",
        "Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.",
        "For extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty cast-iron frying pan on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.",
        "When your bread is risen, use a sieve to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour.

Let it rest for 20 to ~{30%minutes}; this gives the flour a chance to absorb some of the liquid and the bran to soften, making the dough easier to knead.\n\nIf kneading by hand, transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, oil your hands, and knead it for 6 to ~{8%minutes}, or until it's smooth and supple. If kneading in a stand mixer, attach the dough hook and knead for 5 to ~{7%minutes} at low speed, until the dough is soft and smooth. Adjust its consistency with additional flour or water, if necessary.\n\nTransfer the dough to a #lightly greased bowl{}, cover it, and let it rise until puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, 1 to ~{2%hours}.\n\nGently deflate the dough, transfer it to a lightly oiled work surface, and shape it into an 8\" log. Place the log in a lightly greased #8 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" loaf pan{} and cover the pan loosely with lightly greased #plastic wrap or a reusable cover{}.\n\nLet the bread rise for 1 to ~{2%hours}, or until the center has crowned about 1\" above the rim of the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.\n\nUncover the bread, place it in the oven, and bake for 35 to ~{40%minutes}, tenting it lightly with #aluminum foil{} after 20 minutes to prevent over-browning. A digital thermometer inserted into the loaf's center should register at least 190°F.\n\nRemove the bread from the oven and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool. For a soft, flavorful crust, rub the top of the warm bread with a stick of butter. Cool completely before slicing.\n\nStore the bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.\n\nTips from our Bakers\n\nWant to make this bread with the help of your bread machine? Place the dough ingredients into your machine in the order listed and choose the dough or manual cycle. When the cycle is done, remove the risen dough and shape and bake as directed in the recipe above. Note: Due to the many brands of bread machine on the market and their different features, we can’t guarantee you can bake this bread start to finish in your own machine; please use the dough or manual cycle instead.\n\nThe liquid sweetener you choose makes a difference. Molasses produces the darkest loaf, one with old-fashioned flavor. Honey yields a lighter, milder loaf. Maple syrup makes a less-sweet loaf — unless you use real maple syrup, in which case it'll be similar to a loaf made with honey, albeit with a faint hint of maple.\n\nIf you're someone who tends to taste whole wheat as somewhat bitter, try substituting 1/4 cup of orange juice for 1/4 cup of the water in this recipe. A bit of orange juice tones down whole wheat's somewhat tannic taste.\n\nWant to prolong the shelf life of this bread? Try the tangzhong technique, an Asian method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread. Begin by measuring out the flour and water you’ll be using in the recipe. Now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and 1/2 cup of the water; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it forms a thick slurry; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl, let it cool to lukewarm, then combine it with the remaining flour, the remaining water (+ 2 additional tablespoons), and the other dough ingredients. Proceed with the recipe as directed. Well-wrapped and stored at room temperature, your finished loaf should stay soft and fresh at room temperature for at least several days.\n",

Stop right when the batter is fully combined – careful not to over mix.\n\nCover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let it rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}. This will give the leaveners a head start, so each muffin bakes with a tall muffin top in the oven. If you’re in a rush, you can bake the batter right away. They just won’t be as domed on top.\n\nAfter 1 hour, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a #muffin (or cupcake) tin{} with 12 #paper liners{}.\n\nUsing an #ice cream scoop{}, gently run the scoop through the bowl of batter. You’ll notice the batter is very fluffy, so be careful not to disrupt this as you scoop. Just run the scoop through the bowl and pull out the batter. Don’t mix it around or bother it too much.\n\nOver fill each liner just a smidge. You may have about 1 scoop of batter leftover which is to be expected.\n\nTop each muffin with a sprinkle of @coarse sugar{3%Tbsp} and a pile of mini chocolate chips. Really lay on those chocolate chips as they’ll disperse and spread as the muffins grow.\n\nBake at 425°F for ~{8%minutes}. Then, with the oven door still closed, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for another 8 to ~{10%minutes}. You do not need to wait for the temperature to reach 350°F to continue baking, simply just adjust the temperature down to 350°F and set a timer for 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nQuickly test a muffin with a toothpick to see if they’re ready, but try not to keep the oven door open for too long as you do not want the hot air to escape.\n\nRemove the muffins and let them cool for ~{10%minutes}. Then, carefully transfer each muffin to a #cooling rack{}. The muffins may stick to the pan around the bottom edges, so just use a knife to pop them loose if needed.\n\nLet the muffins cool for another 10 to ~{15%minutes}. They’re best served warm so enjoy!\n",

        "Then mix in the vanilla, maple syrup, and vegetable oil followed by the unsalted butter and then buttermilk.",

        "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. This will give the leaveners a head start, so each muffin bakes with a tall muffin top in the oven. If you’re in a rush, you can bake the batter right away. They just won’t be as domed on top.",
        "After 1 hour, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a muffin (or cupcake) tin with 12 paper liners.",
        "Using an ice cream scoop, gently run the scoop through the bowl of batter. You’ll notice the batter is very fluffy, so be careful not to disrupt this as you scoop. Just run the scoop through the bowl and pull out the batter. Don’t mix it around or bother it too much.",
        "Over fill each liner just a smidge. You may have about 1 scoop of batter leftover which is to be expected.",
        "Top each muffin with a sprinkle of coarse sugar and a pile of mini chocolate chips. Really lay on those chocolate chips as they’ll disperse and spread as the muffins grow.",
        "Bake at 425°F for 8 minutes. Then, with the oven door still closed, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for another 8 to 10 minutes. You do not need to wait for the temperature to reach 350°F to continue baking, simply just adjust the temperature down to 350°F and set a timer for 8 to 10 minutes.",
        "Quickly test a muffin with a toothpick to see if they’re ready, but try not to keep the oven door open for too long as you do not want the hot air to escape.",
        "Remove the muffins and let them cool for 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer each muffin to a cooling rack. The muffins may stick to the pan around the bottom edges, so just use a knife to pop them loose if needed.",
        "Let the muffins cool for another 10 to 15 minutes. They’re best served warm so enjoy!"

You can also add one-quarter cup of flour to the recipe, which will produce a chewier doughnut with a less crispy exterior.

If it doesn’t get foamy then you’ll need to do it again.\n\nWhen the active dry yeast is foamy, pour in the @vegetable oil{1%Tbsp}, @melted butter{1/2%cup}, @granulated sugar{1/3%cup}, @evaporated or whole milk{3/4%cup}, @salt{2%tsp}, @vanilla{2%tsp}, @ground cinnamon{2%tsp} and @eggs{2%large}. Break up the eggs with the back of a spatula and allow the dough hook to mix it up a bit, about 30 seconds.\n\nNext, pour the @all-purpose flour{4%cups} in all at once and run the machine for about 5 minutes on medium speed, until the dough is soft and smooth. If you’re doing this by hand, once the dough comes together, you’ll want to dump it out onto your floured counter and knead it for about ~{10%minutes}, until it’s nice and smooth.\n\nRub a #large bowl{} with oil or spray it with cooking spray and place the dough in the center of the bowl. Cover it with a #clean kitchen towel{} and allow it to rise for about ~{1%hour}, until doubled in size.\n\nIn the bowl of stand-up mixer with the paddle attachment (you could also mix this by hand if you don’t have a mixer), add the @unsalted butter{1/2%cup}, @granulated sugar{2/3%cup}, @all-purpose flour{1%cup} and @vanilla{1%tsp} extract. Mix until smooth, about ~{1%minute}.\n\nDivide the dough in two. To one part of the topping, add a drop of #food coloring gel{}. To the other topping, add the @unsweetened cocoa powder{2%tsp} and knead until it’s cohesive.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, divide the dough into 12 equal parts. Or better yet, weigh them into balls of 100 g. Form the balls of dough into rounds. Repeat until you’ve worked through all of the dough.\n\nTake about 2 tablespoons of the topping and rollout using our palms, flatting it into a thin round. Drape it over the round of dough, patting down lightly. Using a #knife{}, cut grooves in the topping like a clam shell. You can also do other types of cuts like criss cross, circles, etc. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about ~{30%minutes}.\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Bake for about 18 to ~{20%minutes}, or until lightly golden brown. Allow to cool. Serve with hot chocolate or coffee.\n\nNote: If you’d like you can use Instant Yeast. Instant Yeast is a bit different than dry active yeast because you mix it into the dry ingredients (vs. activating it in liquid). If you’d like to use Instant Yeast with this recipe, you would mix the first nine ingredients together and then combine the all-purpose and Instant Yeast together. Add the all-purpose flour mixture to the wet ingredients.\n\nNote: Pan Dulce freezes easily. To freeze, bake them and allow them to cool completely. Place on a baking sheet and transfer to the freezer and chill for 1 hour. Transfer the pan dulce to a freezer-safe container and/or freezer-safe bag and freeze for up to 3 months.

Add the @leeks{2%large} and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 5 to ~{8%minutes}. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water to the skillet as needed if the leeks are starting to brown, until they're very tender and starting to break down, another 15 to ~{20%minutes}. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the @grainy Dijon mustard{1%Tbsp}. Season with @salt{} and @pepper{}. Scrape the mixture into a #medium bowl{} and set aside to cool.\n\nWipe out the skillet and set it back on the stove for the mushrooms.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons of the @olive oil{2%Tbsp} to the same skillet and heat over high heat until shimmering.

Reserve the skillet again for toasting the panko.\n\nUnwrap the @flaky olive oil dough{1}, place it on a lightly floured surface, and lightly dust the top with more @flour{}. Roll out the dough, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, into a round about 12 inches in diameter. If it starts to shrink back as you're trying to roll it, cover the dough and let it rest on the surface for ~{10%minutes}, then proceed.\n\nTransfer the dough to the prepared #baking sheet{}. Spread the cooled leek mixture across the surface of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border all the way around. Scatter the cooked mushrooms and garlic (discard the rosemary) over the leeks.\n\nUsing the #parchment paper{} to help you, fold the sides of the pastry up and over the mushrooms, leaving the center open and creating a series of evenly spaced pleats all the way around. Press firmly on the pleats to help the pastry adhere to itself, then brush the exterior of the pastry with more @olive oil{}.

Add the @panko bread crumbs{2%Tbsp}, @nutritional yeast{2%tsp}, 1 grated garlic, and 1 Tbsp rosemary leaves and cook, stirring constantly, until the panko is golden brown and the mixture is very fragrant, about ~{4%minutes}.

Alternatively, use a silicone muffin pan, which needs neither greasing nor paper cups. Place the muffin pan on a #baking sheet{}.\n\nIn a #large bowl{}, rub the @granulated sugar{2/3%cup} and the @lemon zest{1} together with your fingertips until the sugar is moist and the fragrance of the lemon strong. Whisk in the @all-purpose flour{2%cups}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, @baking soda{1/2%tsp}, and @salt{1/4%tsp}.\n\nIn a #large glass measuring cup or another bowl{}, whisk the @sour cream{3/4%cup}, @eggs{2%large}, @vanilla{1%tsp}, @lemon juice{1} and @melted and cooled butter{1%stick} together until well blended. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and, with the #whisk or a rubber spatula{}, gently but quickly stir to blend. Don’t worry about being thorough, a few lumps are better than over-mixing the batter. Stir in the @poppy seeds{2%Tbsp}. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.\n\nBake for 18 to ~{20%minutes}, or until the tops are golden and a thin knife inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a #cooling rack{} and cool for ~{5%minutes} before carefully removing each muffin from its mold. Cool the muffins completely on the rack before icing them.\n\nTo Make the Icing: Put the @confectioners' sugar{1%cup} in a #small bowl{} and add about 1.5 tablespoons of the @lemon juice{3%Tbsp}. Stir with a spoon to moisten the sugar, then add enough additional lemon juice, a dribble at a time, to get an icing that is thin enough to drizzle from the tip of the spoon. You can then drizzle lines of icing over the tops of the muffins or coat the tops entirely, the better to get an extra zap of lemon.\n",

        "In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk the sour cream, eggs, vanilla, lemon juice and melted and cooled butter together until well blended. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and, with the whisk or a rubber spatula, gently but quickly stir to blend. Don’t worry about being thorough, a few lumps are better than over-mixing the batter. Stir in the poppy seeds. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.",
        "Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and a thin knife inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and cool for 5 minutes before carefully removing each muffin from its mold. Cool the muffins completely on the rack before icing them.",
        "To Make the Icing: Put the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl and add about 1.5 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Stir with a spoon to moisten the sugar, then add enough additional lemon juice, a dribble at a time, to get an icing that is thin enough to drizzle from the tip of the spoon. You can then drizzle lines of icing over the tops of the muffins or coat the tops entirely, the better to get an extra zap of lemon."

Using a fork rather than a whisk to beat the eggs helps ensure that you do not overbeat them.\n\nNote: When making more than one omelet, beat the total number of eggs you will need, then use a ladle or measuring cup to pour 3.5 ounces, or about 1/2 cup, for each 2 egg omelet. Keep the butter and filling ingredients by the stove and move quickly, as you make the omelets one by one. Serve them as they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200°F oven and serve when all are finished. If you have more than 4 to make, use another pan, or even two. Attention to more than one pan at a time is a skill that needs to be developed, so practice before your debut. Stagger the cooking so the omelets are not all at the same stage at once.\n\nBeat with a fork until the whites and yolks are blended: 2 large @eggs{2%large}, 1/8 teaspoon @salt{1/8%tsp}, a pinch of black @pepper{1%pinch}.\n\nMelt in an #8 to 10 inch skillet{}, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat: 1 tablespoon @unsalted butter{1%Tbsp}.\n\nTilt the skillet to coat the sides and bottom thoroughly. You can also use nonstick cooking spray or a combination of butter and oil. When the butter is hot and has reached the point of fragrance, but is not brown, pour in the eggs. Meanwhile, agitate the pan forward and backward with the left hand. Keep the egg mass sliding as a whole over the pan bottom. With a dinner fork, quickly swirl the eggs with a circular motion, as shown. Hold the fork so the tines are parallel to, but not scraping, the base of the pan.\n\nAt this point the heat in the pan may be sufficient to cook the eggs, and you may want to lift the pan from the heat as you gently swirl the eggs, as illustrated, in circular scrolls from the edges to the center. Pay no attention to the ridges formed by the fork. The rhythm of the pan and the stirring is like a child's trick of patting the head while rubbing the stomach. Have ready a hot serving plate, which helps to inflate the omelet; choose a heat-resistant one if you plan to glaze. Whether you fill your omelet or leave it plain, grasp the handle of the pan so the left palm is up, as shown. Tip the pan down away from the handle and, with the fork, flip about one third of the omelet over, away from the handle, as shown in the center. If the omelet shows any tendency to stick, discard the fork and give the pan handle a sharp rap or two with the fist, as sketched. The omelet will flip over without the use of a fork and will start to slide. Slant the pan to 90° or more until the omelet makes a second fold in sliding out of the pan and lies with its ends folded under on the plate ready to serve.\n\nGlaze and garnish, if you wish, and serve at once.\n\nFillings for omelets: Herbs, such as @chives{} and @parsley{} or finely grated cheese may be added to the beaten eggs before cooking or more substantial fillings may be placed in the middle of the omelet just before it is rolled.

      "title": "Yeasted Doughnuts with Chocolate Frosting",
      "cooklangSource": ">> source: Cook's Illustrated\n>> serves: 12\n>> total time: 1.75 hours\n\nYou'll need two large baking sheets and two wire racks for this recipe. You'll also need 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters. For the best results, weigh the flour for the doughnuts and the confectioners' sugar for the frosting. Heating the oil slowly will make it easier to control the temperature when frying. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. If the frosting stiffens before you use it, microwave it at 50 percent power, stirring every 30 seconds, until it is smooth and fluid. The frosting can be made up to 48 hours in advance.\n\nFOR THE DOUGHNUTS: Stir @all-purpose flour{4.5%cups}, @sugar{1/2%cup}, and @instant yeast{1%tsp} together in bowl of #stand mixer{}. Add @milk{1/5%cups} and @egg{1%large} and mix with #rubber spatula{} until all ingredients are moistened. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on medium-low speed until cohesive mass forms, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl if necessary. Cover bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let stand for 20 minutes.\n\nAdd @salt{1.5%tsp} and mix on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 5 to ~{7%minutes}. With mixer running, add @unsalted butter{8%Tbsp}, a few pieces at a time, and continue to mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 7 to ~{13%minutes} longer, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer dough to lightly greased #large bowl{}, flip dough, and form into ball. Cover bowl with #plastic{}. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Transfer to refrigerator and chill overnight (or up to 48 hours).\n\nAdjust oven racks to lowest and middle positions. Place loaf pan on lower rack. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and grease parchment. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Press into 8-inch square of even thickness, expelling as much air as possible. Roll dough into 10 by 13-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Using #3-inch round cutter{} dipped in flour, cut 12 rounds. Using #1-inch round cutter{} dipped in flour, cut hole out of center of each round. Transfer doughnuts and holes to prepared #sheet{}. (If desired, use 1-inch cutter to cut small rounds from remaining dough. Transfer to sheet with doughnuts.) Bring #kettle or small saucepan{} of water to boil.\n\nPour 1 cup boiling water into loaf pan. Place sheet on upper rack, uncovered. Close oven and allow doughnuts to rise until dough increases in height by 50 percent and springs back very slowly when pressed with your knuckle, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before end of rising time, add @vegetable oil{2%qts} to #large Dutch oven{} until it measures about 1.5 inches deep and heat over medium-low heat to 360°F. Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Using both your hands, gently place 4 risen doughnuts in oil. Cook until golden brown on undersides, 1 to 1.5 minutes, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 350°F and 365°F. Using #spider skimmer{}, flip doughnuts and cook until second sides are browned, 1 to 1.5 minutes. Transfer doughnuts to prepared rack. Return oil to 360°F and repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, transfer all to oil and stir gently and constantly until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack to cool. Let doughnuts cool completely, about 20 minutes.\n\nFOR THE FROSTING: While doughnuts cool, microwave finely chopped @bittersweet chocolate{4%oz} and @water{1/2%cup} in #medium bowl{} at 50 percent power until chocolate is melted, about 30 seconds. Whisk in @confectioners' sugar{2%cups}, @unsweetened cocoa powder{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%pinch} until smooth and fluid. Let cool slightly.\n\nSet clean wire rack in now-empty sheet. Dip top half of 1 cooled doughnut into frosting until evenly coated, allowing excess to drip back into bowl. Invert doughnut and place on wire rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. Let doughnuts stand until frosting is dry to touch, 15 to ~{30%minutes}, before serving.\n",

        "You'll need two large baking sheets and two wire racks for this recipe. You'll also need 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters. For the best results, weigh the flour for the doughnuts and the confectioners' sugar for the frosting. Heating the oil slowly will make it easier to control the temperature when frying. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. If the frosting stiffens before you use it, microwave it at 50 percent power, stirring every 30 seconds, until it is smooth and fluid. The frosting can be made up to 48 hours in advance.",
        "FOR THE DOUGHNUTS: Stir all-purpose flour, sugar, and instant yeast together in bowl of stand mixer. Add milk and egg and mix with rubber spatula until all ingredients are moistened. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on medium-low speed until cohesive mass forms, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl if necessary. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 minutes.",
        "Add salt and mix on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. With mixer running, add unsalted butter, a few pieces at a time, and continue to mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 7 to 13 minutes longer, scraping down bowl halfway through mixing. Transfer dough to lightly greased large bowl, flip dough, and form into ball. Cover bowl with plastic. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Transfer to refrigerator and chill overnight (or up to 48 hours).",
        "Adjust oven racks to lowest and middle positions. Place loaf pan on lower rack. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and grease parchment. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter. Press into 8-inch square of even thickness, expelling as much air as possible. Roll dough into 10 by 13-inch rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Using 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut 12 rounds. Using 1-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut hole out of center of each round. Transfer doughnuts and holes to prepared sheet. (If desired, use 1-inch cutter to cut small rounds from remaining dough. Transfer to sheet with doughnuts.) Bring kettle or small saucepan of water to boil.",
        "Pour 1 cup boiling water into loaf pan. Place sheet on upper rack, uncovered. Close oven and allow doughnuts to rise until dough increases in height by 50 percent and springs back very slowly when pressed with your knuckle, 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
        "About 20 minutes before end of rising time, add vegetable oil to large Dutch oven until it measures about 1.5 inches deep and heat over medium-low heat to 360°F. Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Using both your hands, gently place 4 risen doughnuts in oil. Cook until golden brown on undersides, 1 to 1.5 minutes, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 350°F and 365°F. Using spider skimmer, flip doughnuts and cook until second sides are browned, 1 to 1.5 minutes. Transfer doughnuts to prepared rack. Return oil to 360°F and repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, transfer all to oil and stir gently and constantly until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to prepared rack to cool. Let doughnuts cool completely, about 20 minutes.",
        "FOR THE FROSTING: While doughnuts cool, microwave finely chopped bittersweet chocolate and water in medium bowl at 50 percent power until chocolate is melted, about 30 seconds. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, and salt until smooth and fluid. Let cool slightly.",

        "In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Add the egg and egg yolks to the cornstarch and mix into a smooth paste.",
        "Slowly, and in small amounts, whisk a little of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. This is called tempering the eggs, which you need to do to get them to the same temperature of the hot milk in the pan, so they won’t curdle.",
        "Once the egg mixture is warm to the touch, pour it back into the milk in the pan. Return the custard to the stove and bring to a boil, whisking continuously, and continue to whisk and cook until smooth and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. The pastry cream will thicken almost immediately but it is important to cook out the starch so that it isn’t grainy and so your pastry cream won’t separate.",
        "Strain the pastry cream into a shallow container and discard the vanilla bean. Because the pastry cream is so thick, you will need to press it through the strainer with a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Set the container in an ice bath or in the freezer for 15 minutes (this cools down the eggs quickly) and then refrigerate for up to a few days.",
        "Place a layer of the vanilla wafers in the bottom of each jar (so you can see the layers).",
        "Make whipped creaming using heavy whipping cream whipped to stiff peaks.",
        "Set aside some whipped cream and banana slices for the top of the puddings, then fold the remaining whipped cream into the pastry cream. Spoon in one-third of the lightened pastry cream over the cookies. Top with half of the banana slices. Add a layer of wafers and repeat with another one-third of pastry cream, remaining bananas, and another layer of wafers (you may not need to use the whole box).",
        "Finish with the remaining pastry cream. Cover and refrigerate for about 5 hours.",
        "When ready to serve, top with the reserved whipped cream and bananas."

You want to have a soft, not sticky dough. Knead extremely lightly to bring together and then wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for ~{5%minutes}.\n\nMeanwhile, line two #baking trays{} with #parchment paper{}.\n\nOnce the dough has chilled, flour the surface and roll out the dough with sharp taps up and down the dough, rather than rolling, flouring the surface more if necessary. Continue to tap the dough up and down until it measures 30 cm by 10 cm.\n\nBrush off any excess flour and fold the bottom third up and the top third down and turn so the dough looks like a closed book. Roll out again to the same size and repeat the fold before freezing again for ~{10%minutes}.\n\nMeanwhile, start making the crème diplomat by making a crème patisserie. Whisk together the @egg yolks{4}, @granulated sugar{110%g} and @all-purpose flour{50%g} and @cornflour{50%g} until well combined and then heat the milk until just before simmering. Add 5 tbsp of @whole milk{580%ml} to the egg mixture and whisk together to combine. Gradually add in the remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Place back in the pan and then bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly until thickened. Once thickened, remove from the heat and then transfer into a bowl and allow to cool completely.\n\nContinue with the pastry and do two more rolls and folds, rolling and folding once more if the butter is still a little streaked. Rewrap in the #plastic wrap{} and allow to freeze for ~{10%minutes} more. Preheat oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / 425°F / Gas 7.\n\nOnce the pastry has chilled, divide in half and roll each piece out carefully to 26 x 26 cm and place on the lined baking trays. Top with another piece of parchment paper and top with two other baking trays.\n\nBake for 25 to ~{30%minutes} or until golden and fully cooked through. Once cooked, remove the top baking tray and allow to cool on the tray.\n\nFor the jam, add the @raspberries{400%g}, @jam sugar{400%g} and @lemon juice{1} to a #large saucepan{}. Breakdown slightly with a #potato masher{}, then heat over low until the sugar has melted.\n\nBring to the boil, then boil for ~{5%minutes}. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to set.\n\nMeanwhile, whisk the crème pat in a stand mixer until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the @heavy cream{300%ml} to soft peaks, then use a little of this whipped cream to slacken the crème pat. Fold through the remaining whipped cream. Transfer into a #piping bag{} with a large round nozzle and then chill until required.\n\nOnce the pastry is cool, trim each square to 24 x 24 cm. Divide each square into 8 rectangles that measure 12 x 6 cm. You should have 16 rectangles.\n\nSieve a quarter of your jam into a bowl, removing the seeds. Transfer the sieved jam to a piping bag and leave to one side until needed.\n\nCombine the @egg white powder{4%tsp} and @water{4%Tbsp} to create a smooth paste. Break the block of @white fondant{400%g} into small pieces and add to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle.\n\nBeat the fondant to break it down, then gradually add the egg white liquid. Continue to beat until you have a smooth, spreadable consistency.\n\nCoat the top of 4 pastry rectangles with the fondant and smooth. Using the sieved jam, create a feathered pattern on each of the fondant topped rectangles.\n\nSpread the remaining pastry rectangles with a small amount of jam, then pipe 3 long rows of crème diplomat blobs to cover.\n\nTo build the millefeuille, stack three crème diplomat topped rectangles on top of each other, then top with a feathered fondant rectangle.\n\nRepeat with the remaining pastry rectangles until you have 4 millefeuille.\n",

The next day, drain the soaked chickpeas and place them in a #saucepan{}, cover with fresh water, add a @bay leaf{1} and simmer for a couple of hours or until the chickpeas are soft. Add @salt{} to taste at the end. Don’t throw away the cooking liquid – this is gold and you’ll need it for the sauce. If using canned chickpeas, skip to next step.\n\nIn another saucepan, gently heat a smashed @garlic{1%clove}, a sprig of @rosemary{1%sprig} (minus the twigs, or remove them before adding the chickpeas) and the @chili (optional){1} in a few tablespoons of @olive oil{}. When the garlic begins to get fragrant and soften, perhaps even slightly color, add the @chopped tomatoes{1/2%14-oz can} and let sizzle for a few minutes.\n\nAdd a ladle-full of the chickpea liquid (if you’ve used canned, use the liquid in the can) and about two-thirds of the chickpeas. Puree the remaining chickpeas before adding to the saucepan to create a creamy, thick sauce. There are some who remove the lump of smashed garlic before adding the chickpea puree – but I leave it in.\n\nAdd more of the chickpea liquid (or water or stock) to the sauce until it is quite watery, then add the @short pasta (ditalini, mista, or rombi){200%g} and cook until the al dente and the sauce has reduced. If you choose to use a long pasta, you may want to cook it separately in a pot of water then simply add it to the ready sauce.\n\nBy the time the pasta has cooked, the sauce should be creamy, not watery, but not too thick either. Like a creamy soup. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper. Ladle into shallow bowls, pour over your very best extra virgin olive oil, more freshly ground pepper and then let it sit for a moment or two before serving as it will be piping hot and it needs to cool a little to be best enjoyed. Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese is entirely optional. Serve this pasta dish with a spoon.\n",

The next day, drain the soaked chickpeas and place them in a saucepan, cover with fresh water, add a bay leaf and simmer for a couple of hours or until the chickpeas are soft. Add salt to taste at the end. Don’t throw away the cooking liquid – this is gold and you’ll need it for the sauce. If using canned chickpeas, skip to next step.",
        "In another saucepan, gently heat a smashed garlic, a sprig of rosemary (minus the twigs, or remove them before adding the chickpeas) and the chili (optional) in a few tablespoons of olive oil. When the garlic begins to get fragrant and soften, perhaps even slightly color, add the chopped tomatoes and let sizzle for a few minutes.",
        "Add a ladle-full of the chickpea liquid (if you’ve used canned, use the liquid in the can) and about two-thirds of the chickpeas. Puree the remaining chickpeas before adding to the saucepan to create a creamy, thick sauce. There are some who remove the lump of smashed garlic before adding the chickpea puree – but I leave it in.",
        "Add more of the chickpea liquid (or water or stock) to the sauce until it is quite watery, then add the short pasta (ditalini, mista, or rombi) and cook until the al dente and the sauce has reduced. If you choose to use a long pasta, you may want to cook it separately in a pot of water then simply add it to the ready sauce.",
        "By the time the pasta has cooked, the sauce should be creamy, not watery, but not too thick either. Like a creamy soup. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper. Ladle into shallow bowls, pour over your very best extra virgin olive oil, more freshly ground pepper and then let it sit for a moment or two before serving as it will be piping hot and it needs to cool a little to be best enjoyed. Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese is entirely optional. Serve this pasta dish with a spoon."

      "cooklangSource": ">> source: Joy of Cooking\n>> serves: 10\n\nNote: Here is ingenuity at its best-light but substantial and delicious, amiably matched with other flavors, well worth the effort. It is traditional to cook and sauce potato gnocchi like pasta and eat them as a first course or one-dish meal.\n\nPreheat the oven to 400°F. Scrub well: 2 pounds @all-purpose or boiling potatoes{2%lbs}.\n\nPrick each potato in a dozen places with a fork. Bake directly on an oven rack until easily pierced with a #fork{}, about ~{1%hour}. While the potatoes are still hot, split therm lengthwise and scoop out the pulp. Push it through a #potato ricer or sieve{} with the back of a #spoon{}. There should be about 2.66 packed cups. Combine the potatoes in a bowl with 1.33 cups @all-purpose flour{1.33%cup}, 1 teaspoon @salt{1%tsp}, and 1/4 teaspoon @nutmeg{1/4%tsp}.\n\nStir vigorously, then turn out onto a work surface knead until smooth and blended. Bring 3 to 4 inches of well-salted water to a simmer in a #large pot{}. Have ready. 3 tablespoons @unsalted butter, melted{3%Tbsp}, or olive oil. Roll about 2 tablespoons of the dough into a 3/4 inch thick cylinder. Cut into 3/4 inch pieces. Roll each piece against the tines of a fork while pressing a small dent on the opposite side with your finger. Test the gnocchi by dropping a few into the simmering water and cooking until they float, about ~{2%minutes}. They should hold a firm shape and be chewy to the bite. If they are too soft or dissolve in simmering water, knead into the dough: (Up to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour and Some beaten egg.\n\nBoth of these have binding properties. Test again. When the dough is right (keep the water hot), roll it into three or four 3/4 inch thick ropes. Cut the ropes into 3/4 inch pieces, shape the dough on the fork as below, letting them drop onto a lightly floured #baking sheet{}. Bring the water back to a simmer. Drop one-third to half of the gnocchi into the pot and simmer, uncovered, until they float, then remove with a #slotted spoon or skimmer{} to a #wide bowl{}. Drizzle some of the melted butter over the gnocchi. Toss to coat. Repeat until all the gnocchi are done. Serve hot with: Additional melted butter and grated Parmesan, a tomato sauce or ragù or Pesto Sauce.\n\nNote: To make gnocchi ahead, spread the uncooked gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet and refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 12 hours. To keep them longer, freeze the gnocchi on the baking sheet until hard, then remove to a freezer bag or container; they will keep frozen for up to 1 month. Cook directly from the freezer, adding about 1 minute to the cooking time.\n",

        "Note: Here is ingenuity at its best-light but substantial and delicious, amiably matched with other flavors, well worth the effort. It is traditional to cook and sauce potato gnocchi like pasta and eat them as a first course or one-dish meal.",
        "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Scrub well: 2 pounds all-purpose or boiling potatoes.",
        "Prick each potato in a dozen places with a fork. Bake directly on an oven rack until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. While the potatoes are still hot, split therm lengthwise and scoop out the pulp. Push it through a potato ricer or sieve with the back of a spoon. There should be about 2.66 packed cups. Combine the potatoes in a bowl with 1.33 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.",
        "Stir vigorously, then turn out onto a work surface knead until smooth and blended. Bring 3 to 4 inches of well-salted water to a simmer in a large pot. Have ready. 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or olive oil. Roll about 2 tablespoons of the dough into a 3/4 inch thick cylinder. Cut into 3/4 inch pieces. Roll each piece against the tines of a fork while pressing a small dent on the opposite side with your finger. Test the gnocchi by dropping a few into the simmering water and cooking until they float, about 2 minutes. They should hold a firm shape and be chewy to the bite. If they are too soft or dissolve in simmering water, knead into the dough: (Up to 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour and Some beaten egg.",
        "Both of these have binding properties. Test again. When the dough is right (keep the water hot), roll it into three or four 3/4 inch thick ropes. Cut the ropes into 3/4 inch pieces, shape the dough on the fork as below, letting them drop onto a lightly floured baking sheet. Bring the water back to a simmer. Drop one-third to half of the gnocchi into the pot and simmer, uncovered, until they float, then remove with a slotted spoon or skimmer to a wide bowl. Drizzle some of the melted butter over the gnocchi. Toss to coat. Repeat until all the gnocchi are done. Serve hot with: Additional melted butter and grated Parmesan, a tomato sauce or ragù or Pesto Sauce.",
        "Note: To make gnocchi ahead, spread the uncooked gnocchi on a lightly floured baking sheet and refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 12 hours. To keep them longer, freeze the gnocchi on the baking sheet until hard, then remove to a freezer bag or container; they will keep frozen for up to 1 month. Cook directly from the freezer, adding about 1 minute to the cooking time."

You can substitute part-skim ricotta for the whole-milk ricotta. Frozen whole-leaf spinach is easiest to squeeze dry, but frozen chopped spinach will work. Squeezing the spinach should remove 1/2 to 2/3 cup of liquid; you should have 2/3 cup of finely chopped spinach. Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment, substitute our Simple Tomato Sauce or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad.\n\nFOR THE GNUDI: Line #rimmed baking sheet{} with double layer of #paper towels{}. Spread @whole-milk ricotta{1.5%cups} in even layer over towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes.

Drizzle broccolini with a bit of oil and season with a pinch each @salt{2/3%tsp} and @pepper{2/3%tsp}.\n\nBake for another 8 to ~{10%minutes}, then remove from oven and add @kale{5.33%handfuls}. Drizzle kale with a touch more oil and season with a pinch each salt and pepper.

Add 5 to 10 Tbsp of @hot water{5%Tbsp} until a pourable sauce is formed. Set aside.\n\nTo serve: slice sweet potatoes into bite size pieces. Divide vegetables between 8 serving bowls and top with chickpeas + tahini sauce.\n\nBest when fresh, though leftovers will keep for a few days in the fridge.\n",

Toss with a little @olive oil{}, and a generous five-finger pinch of @salt{} and @pepper{}. Spread out and bake in the middle of the oven until crispy and tender, 20 to ~{25%minutes}.\n\nCOOK QUINOA: At the same time, bring @dry quinoa{3/4%cup}, water, and pinch of salt to boil in a #medium pot{}.

        "COOK QUINOA: At the same time, bring dry quinoa, water, and pinch of salt to boil in a medium pot. Once boiling, cover, turn heat to low and cook until all the water is gone about 15 minutes. Turn heat off and leave covered. Fluff before serving.",
        "SAUTÉ FILLING: Also at the same time, in a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sauté diced onions 2 to 3 minutes until they just begin to soften. Add garlic, corn, poblano chili, and red bell pepper and lower heat to med, sautéing until tender, about 10 minutes. Season with the salt, cumin, coriander, and oregano. Set aside. When the sweet potatoes are tender, add them to these veggies.",
        "WHIP THE BLACK BEANS: Place 1 can refried black beans into a medium pot, breaking them up with a fork. Add 1/4 cup water (or more) to loosen. Gently warm over medium-low heat, whipping with a fork until they are smooth and creamy. Add a drizzle of olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, chili powder, and cumin. If you don’t care about it being vegan, stir in grated melty cheese (optional) or a dollop of sour cream for extra richness. Whip with fork until creamy and flavorful. You want these to be slightly salty. Cover and turn heat off.",
        "Peruvian BURRITO BOWLS: Spoon some warm whipped black beans into the bottom of a bowl. Top with some quinoa, veggies and AJI VERDE Sauce. Garnish with avocado slices, diced tomatoes, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, sunflower sprouts. If making bowls instead of burritos, I would double the beans for 4-6 people."

Toss to combine.\n\nBake for 20 to ~{25%minutes} or until sweet potatoes are fork tender and slightly caramelized. Set aside to cool. Also reduce oven heat to 350°F (176°C).\n\nIn the meantime, add your @kale{2%cup} to a #large cast-iron or metal skillet{} over medium heat with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water. Cover and steam for about 4 to ~{5%minutes} or until kale is slightly softened but still vibrant green. Uncover and set aside. (You could also sauté the kale in a bit of oil if you prefer.)\n\nAlternatively, sweet @onion (optional){0.5}, about 5 minutes. Also, add black beans to the pot and @garlic (optional){4%cloves} right before the kale.\n\nAdd drained @black beans{8%oz can} to a #mixing bowl{} with steamed kale and roasted sweet potatoes. Add the smaller measurement of @enchilada sauce{0.25%cup} to the kale and sweet potatoes and stir to combine.\n\nWrap @corn tortillas{10%small} in damp cloth towel and microwave to warm for ~{30%seconds} to make more pliable. (Alternatively, place wrapped tortillas directly on oven rack for a few minutes to heat through.) This will help them become more pliable and easy to roll.\n\nPour about one third of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of a #9x13-inch (3 quart | or similar shaped) baking dish{}. Spread to coat.\n\nLay one corn tortilla down in the saucy dish to coat. Then flip it over to coat the other side. Fill with about 1/3 cup of the filling. Then roll up and lay seam-side down at the edge of the dish. Continue until all tortillas are filled and rolled, adding more sauce as needed to moisten tortillas. Add any remaining filling to the edges of the dish. If you run out of space to roll the tortillas in the baking dish, continue saucing, filling, and rolling them on a small serving plate.\n\nPour remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the enchiladas in a stripe down the middle.\n\nTIP: Use less sauce for slightly drier enchiladas. The more sauce you use, the more tender the tortillas will become.\n\nBake at 350°F (176C) for 15 to ~{20%minutes} or until warmed through. Top with desired toppings and serve. We went with fresh @jalapeño (optional){}, @cilantro (optional){}, @green onion (optional){}, @cheese (optional){}, and @avocado crema (optional){}.\n\nLeftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 3 days or in the freezer up to 1 month, though best when fresh.

A pinch of @salt{1%pinch} and @pepper{1%pinch}, @brown sugar{1%tsp}, and @balsamic vinegar{1%tsp} should be added to the @tomatoes{3.5%lbs} that have been cored and halved. Stir it well and bake for ~{25%minutes}. Continue cooking the tomatoes for another ~{5%minutes} or until they begin caramelizing.\n\nRemove the roasting tin from the oven after 25 minutes and place it back on the back burner at medium heat. Add the @vegetable stock{1%qt} and heat until boiling, then simmer for a few minutes. Stir in the @heavy cream{4%oz} and simmer for ~{2%minutes} more.\n\nIf you prefer a chunky rustic soup, you can use a #potato masher{} to ‘blend’ your soup to a thick consistency. The flavors will all mix in your soup rather than if you blend it. Using a #stick blender{} straight in the pan can achieve a traditional cream blend.\n\nPine-Nut Pesto: In a pan, toast the @pine nuts{3%Tbsp} until golden brown and crispy.\n\nGrind the @sun-dried tomatoes{3%oz} in a #mortar and pestle{} until you have an oily paste.\n\nAdd a pinch of @pepper{1%pinch} and the pine nuts, and continue grinding until you obtain the desired consistency for your pesto.\n\nGrate the @Parmesan{2%oz} cheese and add a dash of @olive oil{1%dash} (add some @tomato oil{1%dash} to give it a little extra flavor.) You should have four heaping teaspoons to add to your tomato soup!\n",

Spread @black beans{2%15-oz cans} in a single layer on a #foil-lined rimmed baking sheet{}. Roast until beans are mostly split open and outer skins are beginning to get crunchy, about ~{20%minutes}. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.\n\nWhile beans roast, heat 2 tablespoons @olive oil{4%Tbsp} in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add @onion{1%medium} and @poblano pepper{1%large} and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about ~{5%minutes}. Add @garlic{3%cloves} and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about ~{2%minutes}. Add @chipotle chile in adobo sauce{1} and sauce and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about ~{30%seconds}. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.\n\nPlace @roasted cashews{3/4%cup} in the bowl of a #food processor{} and pulse until chopped into pieces no larger than 1/3-inch, about 12 short pulses. Add to bowl with onions and peppers.\n\nWhen beans are slightly cooled, transfer to food processor. Add @feta or cotija cheese{1/2%cup}. Pulse until beans are roughly chopped (the largest pieces should be about 1/3 of a full bean in size). Transfer to bowl with onion and peppers mixture. Add @panko bread crumbs{3/4%cup}, @egg{1%large}, and @mayonnaise{2%Tbsp} and season with @salt{} and @pepper{}. Fold together gently but thoroughly with hands. Patty mixture can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days at this stage.\n\nTo cook indoors: Form bean mixture into 6 to 8 patties as wide as your @hamburger buns{8}. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add 4 patties and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until well browned and crisp on first side, about ~{5%minutes}. Carefully flip and cook until second side is browned, about ~{5%minutes} longer, adding @pepper jack, cheddar, muenster, or Swiss cheese (optional){} if desired. If cooking more than 4 burgers, cook in batches, keeping cooked burgers on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200°F oven while second batch cooks.\n\nTo cook on the grill: Light 2/3 chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for ~{5%minutes}. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the medium-high setting, cover, and preheat for ~{10%minutes}. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Form bean mixture into 6 to 8 patties as wide as your burger buns and brush top sides with oil. Place on hot side of grill oiled-side down and cook without moving until first side is well browned, 3 to ~{5%minutes}. Brush tops of burgers with oil. Carefully flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, 3 to ~{5%minutes} longer, topping with cheese if desired.\n\nSpread top and bottom buns with chipotle mayonnaise or other condiments as desired.

Add onion and poblano pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chipotle chile in adobo sauce and sauce and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.",

        "When beans are slightly cooled, transfer to food processor. Add feta or cotija cheese. Pulse until beans are roughly chopped (the largest pieces should be about 1/3 of a full bean in size). Transfer to bowl with onion and peppers mixture. Add panko bread crumbs, egg, and mayonnaise and season with salt and pepper. Fold together gently but thoroughly with hands. Patty mixture can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days at this stage.",

Add 4 patties and cook, swirling pan occasionally, until well browned and crisp on first side, about 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until second side is browned, about 5 minutes longer, adding pepper jack, cheddar, muenster, or Swiss cheese (optional) if desired. If cooking more than 4 burgers, cook in batches, keeping cooked burgers on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 200°F oven while second batch cooks.",
        "To cook on the grill: Light 2/3 chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the medium-high setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Form bean mixture into 6 to 8 patties as wide as your burger buns and brush top sides with oil. Place on hot side of grill oiled-side down and cook without moving until first side is well browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Brush tops of burgers with oil. Carefully flip and continue cooking until second side is browned, 3 to 5 minutes longer, topping with cheese if desired.",

Use a knife or toothpick to create small holes in the top of the pie crust to allow steam to escape.\n\nBake pot pies for 35 to ~{40%minutes}, or until the filling is bubbly and the pie crust is golden brown. Let cool ~{10%minutes} before serving.\n\nStore leftovers covered in the refrigerator for 3 to ~{4%days}, or in the freezer up to 1 month.
